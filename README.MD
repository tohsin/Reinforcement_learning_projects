# Implimentation of several Reinforcement Learning algorithms while playing with games and robotics

Several Reinforcement learning algorithms will be implemented and several stargegies willl be vconsidered

## Muzero - Leaning eithout hardcoding rules
## monte carlo tree simulation - Adding search to reinfocement leanging algorithms
## Self Play algorith

## might add genetic algorithms vs rl algorithms to see comperting learning and evolution , importality vs  reproduction
